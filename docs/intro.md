**Dojima Network** - A robust decentralized infrastructure that enables 

- Buffer Zones
- Omni-present Protocols
- Cross-chain Interoperability
- Cross-chain Liquidity Pooling

The robust infrastructure of Dojima Network is powered by Decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators. Dojima Network relies on a set of validators to secure the network. The role of validators is to run a full node; produce blocks, validate, participate in consensus, run relayer and oracle services  and commit checkpoints.

Delegated staking and slashing mechanics act as a backbone for the protocol security and prevent economical incentives for validators to get into collusion.

Dojima Network thrives to create an Cross-chain infrastructure that enables interoperability between protocols in different chains , borderless exchange of assets and creation of market places with tokens pooled from all chains.
