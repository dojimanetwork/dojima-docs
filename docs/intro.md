The blockchain and crypto space has witnessed massive adoption when compared to when the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, first came into the limelight in 2009. Ever since different blockchains (both public and private) have been built by several blockchain enthusiasts, as well as various protocols and Decentralized Applications (Dapps) that interact in these independent blockchains.

In spite of how the blockchain and crypto space has grown over the years, one general problem still persists in the space and has also drawn a lot of attention from crypto natives irrespective of geographical boundaries, and that problem is a fully cross-chain interoperable network. This would allow independent blockchains with their respective protocols and decentralized applications to interact without any form of hindrance

Many cross-chain projects are already operating and others are being built to remedy the issue of interoperability in the crypto space, and one of such is the Dojima Network cross-chain infrastructure project.

Dojima Network is a blockchain technology project that aims to develop a cross-chain infrastructure that will enable interoperability between different blockchains in combination with a middle-ground called a unity chain that will enable developers and users from independent blockchains to meet and interact.

Following the advent of the crypto space, developers have never been able to access the full potential of the various independent blockchains from a single platform. They have not been able to access liquidity from all the blockchains and neither being able to interact with several protocols from all other chains from a single network. Dojima Network is set to solve this problem through its cross-chain infrastructure by creating a common ground (called unity chain), where developers and users can access liquidity from all other blockchains and interact with different protocols. For instance, several cross-chain projects such as Thorchain and Axelar only provide swapping of tokens or wrapped tokens to develop apps. In the case of Dojima Network, it will provide access to the liquidity of different independent blockchains directly from their smart contracts, so as to develop cross-chain dapps based on several defi products, multi-blockchain oracle problems, and a single language for all blockchains to access liquidity.
