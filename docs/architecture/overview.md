# Overview

![medium](/img/medium.png)

Dojima Network is powered by three main components working together:

- **BULLDOG:** Bulldog is the EVM based Buffer zone, built to enable cross-chain exchange, as well as to build complex cross-chain Decentralized Applications. This is the component where all the tokens and contracts reside and interact with each other.

- **WATCHMAN:** Watchman is a Proof of Stake based Byzantine Fault Tolerant state replicating machine, built to securely process and transfer cross-chain data. This component makes all your cross chain transfers safer. Always be assured there is a watchman, guarding your tokens .

- **BRIDGE:** This is the layer responsible for detecting and relaying events between different chains configured in the system.This is one of the main processes performed by POS based Validators.

:::info
And one more thing to state here is that Arweave is used as a backup layer for all of Dojima networks transactions at regular intervals, thus making the dojima network more secure, immutable and permanent.
