# Overview

Dojima Network is built on a multi-layer architecture that consists of two blockchains working together in a decentralized manner with all other blockchains to both access liquidity and acts as a cross-chain platform for developers to develop cross-chain applications. These layers include the Hermes layer and the DojimaChain.

- The Hermes layer is built on top of the Cosmos SDK and tendermint. It is the buffer layer that is connected to various independent blockchains.

- DojimaChain on the other hand is the middle ground layer where developers can deploy applications and access the Hermes layer to get connected to all chains.

Simply put, a buffer layer will be developed on top of Cosmos SDK and tendermint which is connected to all major blockchains and maintains liquidity pools to hold liquidity of the dojima native token and other tokens of major blockchain platforms. The liquidity data will be accessible and signed by all validators at every end of the blocks and supplied to contracts on top of the middle ground, dojima chain, and to be accessed by smart contracts built by cross-chain dapp developers.

Some of the features that Dojima Network offers include:

1. Universal Liquidity Access: This enables developers to access the liquidity of all blockchains directly from their protocols.

2. Cross-Chain Execution and Transfer: This enables users to execute contract code on multiple platforms and also enables cross-chain data transfer to communicate with custom smart contracts.

3. Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools: Through this feature, developers and users can access the cross-chain liquidity pools to execute multiple cross-chain custom-made actions.
